# howto

1. write app description as detailed as posible:
    - functions
    - design
    - techstack (ask copilot what is the best for your app, discuss, descide ) -> modify description

2. let llm write implementation plan:
    - store in markdown
    - iterative
    - let the llm check the plan
    - every feature one step!


3. start building every step. 
    Prompt: after each step, test everything, tell me how to test and what is done and how it works

    - work with featurebranches at git
